## Validation

### HTML Validation

For my HTML files I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Due to using Jinja syntax such as '{% extends "base.html" %} I had to use a different approach to checking my HTML as the validator would show errors if copying the HTML direct from the files in the Happy Heath project. My method to check my HTML was as follows:

- Using the deployed version from Heroku I navigated to each page.
- Right clicking on the page brought up a options menu with the option to view the page source located at the bottom.
- The complete HTML code for that page will then appear in a separate window.
- Copy that code and paste into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
- Check for errors and warnings, fix any issues, and then repeat the steps to revalidate.

All HTML pages were validated and the pages generated solely by myself received a 'No errors or warning to show' result as shown above.

Initially my searh function raised a [warning](documentation/testing/search_validation_error.png) for the role attribute in the search function. The sign up page raised 4 [warnings](documentation/testing/validation_register.png) which is due to Django allauth forms. [Errors](documentation/testing/validator_add_post.png) were raised on the add post page which were generated by Summernote. These [Errors](documentation/testing/validator_edit_post.png) were repeated with the edit post page. The errors on the add_post.html and edit_post.html were cleared after the removal of the summernote widget.

### JavaScript Validation

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the small amount of JavaScript code added to the project. External JS, for Bootstrap purposes, obtained via [CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not validated through JSHint.

| Page | Screenshot | Errors | Warnings |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| base.html | ![js from base.html](documentation/testing/base_js.png) | none | none |
| post_detail.html | ![js from post_detail.html](documentation/testing/post_index_js.png) | none | none |

### Python Validation

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) was used to validate the Python files that were created or edited by myself. No issues presented. I have included some screenshots with the results below.

| Feature | admin.py | forms.py | models.py | urls.py | views.py |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------ | ----- | -----|
| Config | n/a | n/a | n/a | [No Errors](documentation/testing/config_urls.png) | n/a |
| Blog | [No Errors](documentation/testing/blog_admin.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/blog_forms.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/blog_models.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/blog_urls.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/blog_views.png) |
| About | [No Errors](documentation/testing/about_admin.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/about_forms.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/about_models.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/about_urls.png) | [No Errors](documentation/testing/about_views.png) |

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used to validate the CSS file:






External CSS for Bootstrap, provided by [CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not tested.

### Lighthouse Scores

Lighthouse testing was carried out in Incognito mode to acheive the best result. Performance was lower than preferred due to the site being image heavy. Static images used in the sites design were saved in webp. Image types added by a site user are at there own discretion and could affect the score. The CDNs used for Bootstrap were also noted in the Lighthouse report as causing issue with performance. This report will be reviewed for future development of Happy Heath to raise this score.

### Wave Accisibility Evaluation 

![WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](documentation/testing/wave-accissibilty.png)

The WAVE report tool was used to check accisibility and initially raised a number of contrast issues due to the shade of the background colour. This was amended to accomadate and clear the accisibility issues.

## Manual Testing
